//    TRUE if every other digit is even(array positions 1, 3, 5, 7, 9) and array.count == 10
//    If the person calling on this function doesn't enter in any digits (empty array), then we should return false.
//    If the total numbers of digits entered (items in the array) exceed 10, then we should return false.
//    In order to allow access (return true), every other digit (starting with the first digit) must be even. The first digit entered is the first element in the array.

//Maybe make it two checks: one for length, and one for every other character being even
